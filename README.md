# Volcanoes_VEI_ML_project

This ML project aims to predict volcanic eruption intensity (VEI) using data from the Global Volcanism Program. With features like volcano name, location, eruption dates, and VEI, sourced primarily from volcano.si.edu, regression models are built for VEI prediction. Techniques include web crawling, data preprocessing with pandas, and visualization with matplotlib and seaborn.
